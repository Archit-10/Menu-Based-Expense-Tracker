üìå Features

    Add Participants
    Effortlessly add multiple participants by name, each initializing with a balance of zero. This sets the groundwork for tracking each individual‚Äôs share of group expenses.

    Log Expenses
    Record expenses by specifying:
        The payer
        The total amount
        Participants involved in that expense

    PennyWise then calculates each participant's share automatically, allocating costs accurately based on the input.

    View Participants
    List all participants to keep track of who's involved in the current session.

    Show Balance
    See who owes what or gets back money. PennyWise calculates each participant's balance relative to the average contribution, showing a clear picture of who needs to settle up.

    Export to CSV
    With a single click, export the expense data to expenses.csv for easy sharing and record-keeping.
